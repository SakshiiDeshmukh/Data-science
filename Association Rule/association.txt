Association Rule learning is a rule-based machine learning technique 
which is used to find interesting relationships and associations hidden in large data-sets. 
This rule shows how frequently an itemset occurs in a dataset or transaction.

Market Based Analysis is one of the important methods used by large relations to show associations between items. 
Given a set of transactions or dataset, we can find rules that will predict the occurrence of specific item 
based on the occurrences of other items in the dataset.


 Find the closest Association of a given Book/movie data set

2) We Try different values of support and confidence. and Observe the change in number of rules for different support and confidence values

3) Change the minimum length in apriori algorithm

4) Visualize the obtained rules using different plots
