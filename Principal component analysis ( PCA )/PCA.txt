Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular technique for analyzing large datasets containing 
a high number of dimensions/features per observation, increasing the interpretability of data while preserving
the maximum amount of information, and enabling the visualization of multidimensional data.


Perform Principal component analysis and perform clustering using first 3 principal component scores
(Using both heirarchial and k mean clustering
(scree plot or elbow curve) Obtain optimum number of clusters and check whether we have obtained same number of clusters 
with the original data (class column we have ignored at the begining which shows that it has 3 clusters)
